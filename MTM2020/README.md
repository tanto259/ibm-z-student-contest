### Master the Mainframe, 2020

The Master the Mainframe 2020 Grand Challenge challenges us to create a creative output from the skill we have learned. 

For the solution, I created a Python script which calls the z/OSMF REST API to check the status of their jobs, cancel and re-submit them. A full technical reflection of my solution can be found at [securitypuppy.com/jobs-py](https://securitypuppy.com/jobs-py).

To use the solution, ensure that Python 3 is installed on your local workstation. Then, you can just enter `python3 jobs.py`. It will then return more instructions which can be followed.
